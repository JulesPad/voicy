<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

What if you could access LLMs' huge power by using your voice with a simple shortcut? It is what Voicy allows you to do
  
As a huge multitasking power-user and of ChatGPT I found myself struggling to ask quick questions while doing something else, I also missed not having a simpler and more natural way to communicate.
  
If you are a multitasking power-user wanting to have access by voice to an AI assistant, an Iron Man fan wanting to reproduce Jarvis ðŸ¤–, or impress your friends with an actually smart voice assistant; Voicy is for you!

Here are some of the main features of Voicy ðŸ’¡:
* Custom prompts, craft your entirely custom prompt to create whatever personality you want in ChatGPT. Or feel free to use the optimized Voicy prompt.
* Always-on shortcut, one you run the script Voicy will wait for the shortcut to be activated and will run in the background without you having to do anything
* Auto-install the required packages, no need to bother yourself with installing them; Voicy handles this for you.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Voicy's intallation is very simple and fast, you will only need to clone the repository and add your OpenAI and Elevenlabs API keys. Then simply choose the script that is made for your platfrom, and your are ready to go!

### Prerequisites

For Voicy to work you will need 2 API keys, one from OpenAI for ChatGPT and voice-to-text to work, and one from Elevenlabs for speech synthesis to work. 

For both APIs you get access to free credits:

* **OpenAI**: While creating an account with a never used phone number you have automatically $5 of free credit on your account. It is plenty enough to use Voicy for serval long months. 

* **Elevenlabs**: Once you created your Elevenlabs account you get 10K characters free that renew monthly. If you generate long answers regularly the free quota could become short for you. You can upgrade for $0.95 and then $5 monthly to get access to 30K characters. 

Here are some step by step tutorials to get your API key for [OpenAI](https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/how-to-get-an-openai-api-key) and  [Elevenlabs](https://docs.elevenlabs.io/authentication/01-xi-api-key)

### Installation

1. Get your free API keys
2. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/JulesPad/voicy.git
   ```
3. Go to the installation path to find the scripts. Open the script that you want to use and move on to step 4
4. Once you have the Python script opened modify at the beginning of the script the 2 following variables:
   ```py
   openai.api_key = "YOUR_KEY"

   user = ElevenLabsUser("YOUR_KEY")
   ```
6. If you are on **MacOS** don't forget to allow input monitoring from your terminal in the system's settings. 
5. Feel free to modify the prompt and other parameters! Enjoy ðŸ˜„
